                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>

                <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                    recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical
                    problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more
                    likely to develop serious illness.</p>

                <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
                    disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your
                    hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</p>

                <p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
                    infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette
                    (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

                <p>At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many
                    ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.</p>

                <p>SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) – virus identified in 2003. SARS-CoV is thought to be an animal virus
                    from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats)
                    and first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002.</p>
                <p> An epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases in 2003. Since then,
                    a small number of cases have occurred as a result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through
                    animal-to-human transmission (Guangdong, China).</p>

                <p>Transmission of SARS-CoV is primarily from person to person. It appears to have occurred mainly
                    during the second week of illness, which corresponds to the peak of virus excretion in respiratory
                    secretions and stool, and when cases with severe disease start to deteriorate clinically. Most cases
                    of human-to-human transmission occurred in the health care setting, in the absence of adequate
                    infection control precautions. Implementation of appropriate infection control practices brought the
                    global outbreak to an end.</p>

                <p>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus transferred to humans from
                    infected dromedary camels. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and
                    people, and it is contractable through direct or indirect contact with infected animals. MERS-CoV
                    has been identified in dromedaries in several countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.
                    In total, 27 countries have reported cases since 2012, leading to 858 known deaths due to the
                    infection and related complications.</p>

                <p>The origins of the virus are not fully understood but according to the analysis of different virus
                    genomes it is believed that it may have originated in bats and later transmitted to camels at some
                    point in the distant past.</p>

                <p>Human-to-human transmission is possible, but only a few such transmissions have been found among
                    family members living in the same household. In health care settings, however, human-to-human
                    transmission appears to be more frequent.</p>

                <p>Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal
                    illness affecting humans and other primates.</p>

                <p>The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human
                    primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood,
                    secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g.
                    bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.</p>

                <p>The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in
                    past outbreaks.</p>

                <p>The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The
                    2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus
                    was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others
                    combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to
                    Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p>

                <p>It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts.</p>
